## How did we make it?

- Arduino to control the servo motor, ultrasonic sensor as well as the motor driver. (C++)
- Raspberry Pi used to control the Arduino. (Python)
- Webcam for real-time video of the road, that is sent to the Raspberry Pi to make sure the car stays on the road as well as signal detection. (Computer Vision)
- Ultrasonic Sensor for obstacle detection. (C++)
